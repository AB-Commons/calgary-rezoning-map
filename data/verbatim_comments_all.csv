4859,455,5,Support – Housing Affordability & Supply,support,False,4.,"4. If the City moves toward “R-CG” I’m told it will put more focus on Development Permits than currently exists – which is important, for the following reason - more efficient review of permits and applications – by trained planners & staff. 5. When the City proposes changes in Established ‘Newer’ and Well-maintained Neighbourhoods, residents need: 5.1. Input into proposed changes in that locale. 5.2. There must be a simple and effective way for individuals to participate. I suggest a list of guidelines and topics that individuals can use to effectively provide input into proposed changes by the City. I suggest a “list of topics” (provided by the City) that are pertinent to reasons why (or why not) a person would agree to changes. Residents need a list they can follow and identify – in “planner-speak” in order to make valid points. (I am told that a statement like: “We just don’t want a 4plex in our neighbourhood”… doesn’t carry any weight; therefore, we need the list.) It needs to be simple and have priority ranking of topics. Your job is to make it easier for residents and taxpayers to help you do your job – and make Calgary a better place to live. 6. Non-resident/Investor Home Ownership: this ‘elephant in the room’ needs to be addressed. The inflated housing market is affected significantly by persons buying homes purely to rent or flip. I know a number of friends who make good income doing this; likely numerous City officials also fall into that group. If there was a way to make people simply buy a home to live in… our housing crisis would likely not exist. Prices have inflated because of low interest rates and the interest in buyers who are NOT simply buying a home to live in. The City needs to research regulations to either: - Make it difficult to buy property simply to rent it of flip it, like increased taxes on a home not held for several years, or - Tax those property-owners so the City can help fund ‘densification’. 6.1. Taxation tools would work; Invermere, B.C. has a large increase in residential taxes for “nonresidents” (18% or 26% (<65 yrs) 6.2. Regulation on home-owners needing to “residents of Canada” might work.",0.5458,-0.127

Attach Yes/No Question on Tax Bills typewritten response: City of Calgary Rezoning Proposal 2024-02-07 My name is [redacted]. I am a professional designer and have been working in architectural design, construction and community planning for over 40 years. There is so much that's wrong and ill conceived about the current vague proposal for rezoning in the City of Calgary, that I really don't know where to start. It appears to me that ""the City"" realized that they could get $228 million dollars if they showed Ottawa that they were going to build more housing and create more housing density in Calgary and this became the driving factor in what appears to me to be a lazy and hurried broad brush across 80% of the city with no regard to what this will mean for neighbourhoods where families have made the largest investment of their lives. City management at its worst. I assume that someone drew a circle around the light rail trains and said - OK, any neighbourhood within the circle can be destroyed - the character of the neighbourhood doesn't matter. The location and nature of infill accomodation within the neighbourhood doesn't matter. The value of the existing homes doesn't matter. Increased density, as blithely described on the website, means that there will be major parking issues and increased parking costs within all neighbourhoods - but, oh yah, the website says we can use our bicycles and oh yah, the city is going to do something with the sidewalks that will solve something? But they've thought about how to solve the problem of having 4 times the compost, recycle and waste bins - we're going to share these - like that will work. The City of Calgary pretends that people can use public transit",-0.8164,-0.0009
4904,458,5,Support – Housing Affordability & Supply,support,False,but that is simply not true.,"but that is simply not true. The City pretends that transit means getting to the light rail station and taking the train to your destination. The train serves such a narrow corridor that I can't get to my destinations at the other end of the trip and if I can, it takes hours to do it. Calgary has been built over the past hundred years, as a place where personal vehicles are necessary. If you want to make changes to this, you have to first improve public transport to the stage where it will actually be functional before screwing up the neighbourhoods and causing individual home values to decrease. City planning pretends that proposals for infills will be vetted and approved, only if appropriate for the neighbourhood. Well, I don't believe you and I have no faith in the city process. I have seen some great infill projects in inner city neihbourhoods and causing individual home values to decrease. My statement doesn't cover all of my misgivings but it's a start. For city management to present this vague plan to the ciy council and for the mayor and city council to present this to the public is beyond belief.",0.5677,0.0673

For example, in Haysboro most homes are single storey bungalows or split levels. The maximum heights should be that of split level houses regardless if proposed project is a duplex or fourplex. On main thoroughfares, i.e. Elbow Drive, projects could be of higher height, as City is proposing. As another example, in Pumphill or Oakridge, most homes are larger two storey, so again a height that is similar to existing architecture, would fit within the community and not cause distress and pushback by residents who are going to lose privacy, sunlight, natural light, and loss of choice in what is built next to their home. - What is missing when you overbuild in heights is every design I've seen in Altadore, Erlton among others, is the complete loss of the existing, mature urban canopy. In all these areas, all mature trees have been cut down to expedite construction activity. - Presently the City is touting this zone change as environmentally progressive. This is while the City itself has said that there is about 1 billion dollar value of trees within Calgary. - Calgary was blackmailed Federally to approve blanket zoning, saying this was a bold move. I beg to differ - when the City of Windsor, decided to listen and take into consideration the citizen's/taxpayers/voters concerns. That is a bold move. - All of your constituents want is consideration of the character and integrity of established neighbourhoods, namely height, and finding a way to address that concern.

Background: I think many of us would agree, we are starting to see more problems due to poor planning with the high immigration policy we have had for a number of years. As Canadians, we want to be a generous people. We do however have limitations: economic or financial, social, environmentally. We need to available to take our share of the world's refugees and people with humanitarian needs that are legitimate. The additional number of immigrants Canada takes, which directly affects population growth, needs to be carefully considering overall Canadians needs, preferences and limitations, and proactive planning. Canada, as decided by the Federal Government, has decided for a number of years to take a proportional amount of immigration has for a number of years which is much higher than other developed countries. This has been done without fully informing and educating overall Canadians of the negative and positive impacts of different levels of immigration and composition for Canada. Increasing population rates too quickly can bring a lot of problems without proper planning. As an example, the housing dilemma we have today has been exacerbated with high population growth. The reactionary measures being proposed today are an example of poor proactive planning. How do you do proactive planning? You do a comprehensive study on Immigration Intake into Canada. They study would dig deepl into fiscal or economic, social and environmental impacts of different levels of immigration, and then develop conclusions and recommendations.",0.6061,0.6672

This is stellar study to inform and educate Canadians on immigration and to be used as guide in deciding on immigration levels and the planning needed to accommodate the resulting population growth. One of the major points in the report is the need for responsible planning for infrastructure to accommodate population growth. Is the Federal Government resistant to doing a report like this? Yes.

The City can appropriate land and sell or lease it; the City can back co-op housing; the City can set rules for a percentage of all new inner city major developments to have units available at lower rates. This is the case in central Paris and Vienna, where lower income housing is mandated regardless of location and is impressively a success. Surely affordable housing for the ""missing middle"" can be achieved far more effectively in ways other than rezoning very expensive single home lots? Do we not need a far better blend of social housing, co-op housing, affordable rentals and market rentals, plus single family homes and large scale projects with new rules attached? • There are still vast industrial properties near the inner city.

The cement plant along 12th St SE, industrial properties all along Ogden Rd - and many more location in the near-in southeast. Could some of them not be relocated? Isn't this inner city land now far more suited to residential and business development? • Blanket upzoning does not deal with the concerns and needs of different communities and relies on the market to create what the City needs.
